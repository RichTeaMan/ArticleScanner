A search continues in the Melbourne park where the eighth man to be shot dead in as many weeks in the city was found. 

State Emergency Service volunteers and police returned to Fawkner Park at South Yarra on Sunday following the murder of a 41-year-old Carnegie man, whose body was discovered by two members of the public on Friday night. 

The search comes after two guns were found at the park, reportedly by children. 

Police believe the latest shooting was a targeted attack. “There’s no evidence to suggest it was a random shooting,” Sen Sgt Andrew Brady told reporters on Saturday. 

Melbourne nightclub shooting leaves security guard dead and man critical Read more“We want to reassure the public that Victoria police is working towards successfully resolving this investigation.” 

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

A search continues in the Melbourne park where the eighth man to be shot dead in as many weeks in the city was found. 

State Emergency Service volunteers and police returned to Fawkner Park at South Yarra on Sunday following the murder of a 41-year-old Carnegie man, whose body was discovered by two members of the public on Friday night. 

The search comes after two guns were found at the park, reportedly by children. 

Police believe the latest shooting was a targeted attack. “There’s no evidence to suggest it was a random shooting,” Sen Sgt Andrew Brady told reporters on Saturday. 

Melbourne nightclub shooting leaves security guard dead and man critical Read more“We want to reassure the public that Victoria police is working towards successfully resolving this investigation.” 

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

A search continues in the Melbourne park where the eighth man to be shot dead in as many weeks in the city was found. 

State Emergency Service volunteers and police returned to Fawkner Park at South Yarra on Sunday following the murder of a 41-year-old Carnegie man, whose body was discovered by two members of the public on Friday night. 

The search comes after two guns were found at the park, reportedly by children. 

Police believe the latest shooting was a targeted attack. “There’s no evidence to suggest it was a random shooting,” Sen Sgt Andrew Brady told reporters on Saturday. 

Melbourne nightclub shooting leaves security guard dead and man critical Read more“We want to reassure the public that Victoria police is working towards successfully resolving this investigation.” 

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

State Emergency Service volunteers and police returned to Fawkner Park at South Yarra on Sunday following the murder of a 41-year-old Carnegie man, whose body was discovered by two members of the public on Friday night.

Police believe the latest shooting was a targeted attack. “There’s no evidence to suggest it was a random shooting,” Sen Sgt Andrew Brady told reporters on Saturday. 

Melbourne nightclub shooting leaves security guard dead and man critical Read more“We want to reassure the public that Victoria police is working towards successfully resolving this investigation.” 

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers.

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

Police believe the latest shooting was a targeted attack. “There’s no evidence to suggest it was a random shooting,” Sen Sgt Andrew Brady told reporters on Saturday.

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

State Emergency Service volunteers and police returned to Fawkner Park at South Yarra on Sunday following the murder of a 41-year-old Carnegie man, whose body was discovered by two members of the public on Friday night. 

The search comes after two guns were found at the park, reportedly by children. 

Police believe the latest shooting was a targeted attack. “There’s no evidence to suggest it was a random shooting,” Sen Sgt Andrew Brady told reporters on Saturday.

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

A search continues in the Melbourne park where the eighth man to be shot dead in as many weeks in the city was found. 

State Emergency Service volunteers and police returned to Fawkner Park at South Yarra on Sunday following the murder of a 41-year-old Carnegie man, whose body was discovered by two members of the public on Friday night. 

The search comes after two guns were found at the park, reportedly by children. 

Police believe the latest shooting was a targeted attack. “There’s no evidence to suggest it was a random shooting,” Sen Sgt Andrew Brady told reporters on Saturday. 

Melbourne nightclub shooting leaves security guard dead and man critical Read more“We want to reassure the public that Victoria police is working towards successfully resolving this investigation.” 

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

A search continues in the Melbourne park where the eighth man to be shot dead in as many weeks in the city was found. 

State Emergency Service volunteers and police returned to Fawkner Park at South Yarra on Sunday following the murder of a 41-year-old Carnegie man, whose body was discovered by two members of the public on Friday night. 

The search comes after two guns were found at the park, reportedly by children. 

Police believe the latest shooting was a targeted attack. “There’s no evidence to suggest it was a random shooting,” Sen Sgt Andrew Brady told reporters on Saturday. 

Melbourne nightclub shooting leaves security guard dead and man critical Read more“We want to reassure the public that Victoria police is working towards successfully resolving this investigation.” 

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

Police have not confirmed whether they had identified any suspects and could not say what type of gun was used. As of Sunday no arrests have been made. 

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.”

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.

It is the latest in a deadly two months on Melbourne’s streets. Eight men have died in six shootings since 1 March and charges have been laid for only three of the attacks. 

The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said gun crime was out of control in Melbourne and police needed more resources and powers. 

“When you get people gunned down at Fawkner Park, you get people gunned down waiting to go into a nightclub – this is not the Victoria we need,” he told reporters. 

“The police need more support to infiltrate these gangs and get to the bottom of why this violence is happening.” 

The police minster, Lisa Neville, said in a statement police were targeting organised crime through new firearm prohibition orders, which came into effect last year. 

“Illegal firearms have no place in our community and we’re working with Victoria police to target those who seek to use or acquire them,” she said. “Through our record investment in community safety, we’re giving police the laws, resources and equipment they need to keep Victorians safe.” 

Since the prohibition orders came into place, 165 orders have been approved and of those more than 145 have been served on individuals, including outlaw motorcycle gang members, Middle Eastern crime gang members and counterterrorism persons of interest.
